## What is Atlan CLI?

Atlan is a CLI tool based on [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) that helps you to manage complex local dockerized infrastructure.


## Use Atlan CLI


Please read the full [documentation](./docs/README.md).

## Integrate Atlan CLI in your CLI


Atlan is based on [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) cli builder. 
If you have a custom commander CLI, you can integrate Atlan in your CLI by requiring it with theses simple lines of code:

```js
const atlan = require('atlan');

```
## Philosophy and goals


Atlan is a tool that was designed to simplify the life of developers. You don't need to know Docker to use it, Atlan does it for you in a very simple way. Its goal is and will remain to simplify the daily life of its users.

Atlan must and will have to respect some main DX principles:

1. **Ease of use**

The entire Atlan API must be described and understandable by any developer without having to consult any other source than Atlan itself.

2. **Evolutivity**

Atlan will inevitably evolve over time. Even if it does evolve, the API must minimize the affordance that Atlan users may encounter.

3. **Contributability**

Atlan is and will remain an open source tool. Contributing to its evolution should therefore always be easy and accessible to anyone who wants to help improve it.
